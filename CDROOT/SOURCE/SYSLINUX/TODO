- Clean up the command-line parsing.

- Cleaned up documentation, with a real man page.

- Support for clusters larger than 16K.  This would require changing
  a lot of the SYSLINUX internals so we can read partial clusters;
  change the current "cluster pointers" to become
  "cluster:sector pointers".  (32K may be doable.)  Microsoft
  documentation claims that 32K is the maximum legal value although
  "some versions of some systems allow 64K".

- EBIOS support.

- FAT32 support?

- Support files that span multiple input media

- Clean up the handling of sections

- Add "localboot" support to SYSLINUX (using the ISOLINUX feature set.)
