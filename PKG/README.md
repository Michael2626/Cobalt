================

These are packages used by the Cobalt installer. They are compressed into ZIP files during the compiler process, and copied to CDROOT for use by the installer.

### Base

'Base' is the package that contains most of the software included with Cobalt.

### Desktop

'Desktop' only contains the [OpenGEM](https://github.com/shanecoughlan/OpenGEM) 7 RC3 desktop.
